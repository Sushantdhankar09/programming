        <blockquote style="font-size: 40px;" align="center">Programming is the art of telling another human being what
            one wants the computer to do. - Donald Ervin

        <p align="center">Computer programming is the process of performing particular computations (or more generally,
            accomplishing specific computing results), usually by designing and building executable computer programs.
            Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and
            resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms (usually in a particular programming language,
            commonly referred to as coding). The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are
            intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing
            unit. To produce machine code, the source code must either be compiled or transpiled. Compiling takes the
            source code from a low-level programming language and converts it into machine code. Transpiling on the
            other hand, takes the source-code from a high-level programming language and converts it into bytecode. </p>
